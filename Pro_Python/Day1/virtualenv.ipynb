    "## Virtual Environment in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** in Python is an isolated workspace that allows you to install and manage packages independently from the global Python installation. This helps avoid conflicts between dependencies required by different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation:** Keeps project dependencies separate.\n",
    "- **Version Control:** Allows different projects to use different versions of packages.\n",
    "- **Reproducibility:** Makes it easier to share and reproduce environments.\n",
    "- **Prevents Conflicts:** Avoids breaking system-wide packages.\n",

    "## Ways to Create Virtual Environments in Python\n",

    "### 1. Using `venv` (Standard Library)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Create a virtual environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m venv myenv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Activate the environment:**\n",
    "    - **Windows:**  \n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - **macOS/Linux:**  \n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      source myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "3. **Deactivate:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    deactivate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Using `virtualenv` (Third-party Package)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Install virtualenv:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install virtualenv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Create a virtual environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    virtualenv myenv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Activate/Deactivate:**  \n",
    "    Same as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Using `conda` (Anaconda/Miniconda)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Create a virtual environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda create --name myenv python=3.10\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Activate the environment:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda activate myenv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Deactivate:**\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda deactivate\n",

    "\n",
    "## Main Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- Virtual environments are essential for managing dependencies and avoiding conflicts.\n",
    "- Python provides built-in (`venv`) and third-party (`virtualenv`, `conda`) tools.\n",
    "- Activation and deactivation commands differ by platform and tool.\n",
    "- Always use a virtual environment for each project to ensure clean, reproducible workflows."
