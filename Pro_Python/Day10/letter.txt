Overview

File handling allows us to store data permanently outside the program (on disk).
In Python, we use the built-in open() function to work with files.
Files can be text files (.txt, .csv, .json) or binary files (.jpg, .exe, .mp4).

  Why it exists:

Programs need persistent storage (data should not disappear after program ends).

Useful for reading configurations, saving logs, storing user data, processing large datasets.

   Where it’s used:

Storing user input permanently.

Reading data from CSV/JSON/XML.

Writing logs in applications.

Machine Learning → loading datasets.

System utilities → reading/writing configuration files.Use .strip() when reading lines (removes
