    "## English Description of Producer-Consumer Synchronization Program\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "This program demonstrates a classic multi-threading pattern called the \"Producer-Consumer Problem\" where one thread creates items and another thread consumes them, with proper synchronization to prevent conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shared Buffer:** A queue (deque) that can hold a maximum of 5 items at any time\n",
    "2. **Synchronization Tool:** A condition variable that helps threads communicate and wait for each other\n",
    "3. **Two Types of Workers:** Producer thread (creates items) and Consumer thread (removes items)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Producer Function Works:**\n",
    "- Takes a name and number of items to produce as inputs\n",
    "- Runs in a loop to create the specified number of items\n",
    "- Each item is labeled with the producer's name and a sequence number (like \"P-0\", \"P-1\")\n",
    "- Before adding an item to the buffer:\n",
    "  - Acquires a lock to safely access the shared buffer\n",
    "  - Checks if the buffer is full (5 items max)\n",
    "  - If full, waits until a consumer removes something\n",
    "  - If space available, adds the new item to the buffer\n",
    "  - Prints a message showing what was produced and current buffer size\n",
    "  - Notifies all waiting consumer threads that a new item is available\n",
    "- Sleeps for a random time between 0.1 and 0.4 seconds before making the next item\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Consumer Function Works:**\n",
    "- Takes a name and number of items to consume as inputs\n",
    "- Runs in a loop to consume the specified number of items\n",
    "- Before taking an item from the buffer:\n",
    "  - Acquires a lock to safely access the shared buffer\n",
    "  - Checks if the buffer is empty\n",
    "  - If empty, waits until a producer adds something\n",
    "  - If items available, removes the oldest item from the front of the buffer\n",
    "  - Prints a message showing what was consumed and current buffer size\n",
    "  - Notifies all waiting producer threads that space is now available\n",
    "- Sleeps for a random time between 0.1 and 0.4 seconds before consuming the next item\n",
    "\n",
    "**Program Execution Flow:**\n",
    "1. Creates two separate threads - one producer named \"P\" and one consumer named \"C\"\n",
    "2. Both threads are set to handle 10 items each\n",
    "3. Starts both threads running simultaneously\n",
    "4. The main program waits for both threads to complete their work\n",
    "5. Prints \"done\" when everything is finished\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Synchronization Rules:**\n",
    "- Only one thread can access the buffer at a time (mutual exclusion)\n",
    "- Producers must wait when buffer is full\n",
    "- Consumers must wait when buffer is empty\n",
    "- Threads notify each other when conditions change (item added/removed)\n",
    "- Random sleep times simulate real-world processing delays\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** There appears to be a syntax error in the original code where `n*items` should likely be `n_items` in the consumer function's range statement."
